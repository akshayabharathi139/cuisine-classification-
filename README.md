🔹 Task 3: Cuisine Classification
This project focuses on building a multi-class classification model to predict the cuisine type of a restaurant based on its attributes such as name, location, and reviews. It's part of the Machine Learning Internship at Cognifyz Technologies.

📌 Objective
To classify restaurants into various cuisine categories (e.g., Indian, Chinese, Italian, etc.) using supervised learning techniques.

🧠 Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and vectorizing text data.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from restaurant metadata.
Modeling: Applied algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (for ML models and metrics)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
